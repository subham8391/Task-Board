# Task Board

In this project we are making a task board that tracks our tasks, we can add, delete and modify our tasks. Also, we can filter and sort the task.

# How does the project work?
Add first when we add a task the task will added to the pending state by default. After changing the status in the edit task they will add to the specific state. If we choose InProgress it will add to the inProgress state.
Every task has one action button and the action button has to type of button edit and delete.
In edit button, we can see the details of the task we can't change or edit everything we just change the status and priority. By changing status we can send the task to the selected state. Once we put the task in completed state we can't edit or delete it.
The delete button has two buttons yes or no clicking on yes delete the task and clicking on no we came out to the main page.
Here we can filter the tasks by assignees, priority, and date and sort the tasks by priority.
